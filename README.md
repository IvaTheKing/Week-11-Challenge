# Week-11-Challenge

This is my week 11 challenge, aka, the Note Taker. This is one I struggled with (common motife since NO EXAGERATION, 70-80% of the breakout rooms that I was put in
from like week 4 through the rest of the course, I was in rooms with 3 people with no mics, no cams, no help, no nothing. Thanks though. Here's my attempt!
